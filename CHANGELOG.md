# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
This project has no semantic versioning — the latest commit is the current version.
Changes are grouped by date.

## [2026-09-08]

### Changed

- `drupal-sdc-figma-verify` skill: token lookup now reads the `design/` layer and the generated theme foundation first; the theme's `figma-token-mapping.md` is used only as a brownfield fallback when no design layer exists.

### Removed

- `drupal/drupal-sdc-generation` skill: superseded by the sf-drupal-harness skill of the same name.
- `system/figma-bridge` skill: moved to sf-drupal-harness (`skills/design/figma-bridge`).

## [2026-09-07]

### Changed

- Upstream skill sync: refresh `angular/angular-developer` and `system/playwright-cli` from the declared source repositories.
- `glab` and `gh` skills: the AI attribution header now names the agent and model that wrote the content (`> :robot: _This was written by an AI agent on behalf of @user (claude-code/claude-opus-5)._`), using the same identity as the `Assisted-by` commit trailer.
- `glab` and `gh` skills: the attribution header can be omitted, but only when explicitly asked for. The agent never proposes leaving it out.

### Fixed

- `glab` and `gh` skills: the username for the AI attribution header is now fetched in the same command that posts the content. The previous two-step example relied on a shell variable surviving between commands, which produced a header with an empty `@` mention.

## [2026-09-02]

### Changed

- `spark-http-proxy` skill: `hosts describe` is documented as reading the container live (image, status, routed port and backend, network, reachability, mounts, redacted command)

## [2026-09-01]

### Changed

- `spark-http-proxy` skill: the certificate commands are documented as the `certs` topic (`list`, `describe`, `generate`, `delete`); `certs describe` is the first step on a certificate warning, and the deprecated `generate-mkcert`, `list-certs` and `remove-cert` warnings are explained as expected
- `security-assessment` and `agentic-security-audit` skills: moved from `skills/system/` to a new optional `security` category. They are no longer installed by default; enable them with `ajust sf-harness-category enable security` or `sjust sf-harness-category enable security`

## [2026-09-01]

### Added

- `spark-http-proxy` skill: document `hosts`, which reports what the proxy serves and the directory local containers run from

## [2026-08-31]

### Changed

- `spark-http-proxy` skill: `tailscale-peers --refresh` replaces the removed `tailscale-refresh-peers`
- `spark-http-proxy` skill: the peer table has two groups, `PROXY` and `EXCLUDED`, with the reason in a `STATUS` column

### Removed

- `spark-http-proxy` skill: the `evals/` directory, because nothing in this repository runs it (see #159)

- Upstream skill sync: refresh `angular/angular-developer` from the declared source repository.

## [2026-08-30]

### Added

- `spark-http-proxy`: cover tailnet peer routing, which makes a hostname served on one machine reachable under the same name from the other machines of the same Tailscale account. New `references/peer-routing.md` with how to turn it on, how to read the discovery report, why a hostname is not reachable yet, what `not this proxy` means, and what differs on macOS.
- `spark-http-proxy`: cover why HTTPS to a peer hostname is untrusted. TLS terminates locally, so the machine doing the reaching needs the certificate, and a wildcard covers exactly one label, so `*.spark.loc` does not cover `macos.test.spark.loc`.

### Fixed

- `spark-http-proxy`: the Linux DNS drop-in was documented as pointing at the Docker bridge `172.17.0.1:19322` in a file named `docker-dev-dns.conf`. It is `127.0.0.1:19322` in `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/http-proxy.conf`, so advice based on the old text sent users to a target that does not answer.

## [2026-08-24]

### Changed

- Upstream skill sync: refresh `angular/angular-developer`, `system/domain-modeling`, and `system/grilling` from the declared source repositories.

## [2026-08-17]

### Changed

- Upstream skill sync: refresh `system/domain-modeling`, `system/grill-me`, `system/grill-with-docs`, and `system/grilling` from the declared source repositories.

## [2026-08-13]

### Changed

- Taught the `spark-http-proxy` skill about `VIRTUAL_PATH`, which mounts a container under a path of its `VIRTUAL_HOST` so a browser-served frontend and its API can share one origin locally. Covers the compose shape, that matching is by path segment and nothing is stripped, that a certificate covers a hostname rather than a path, and the failure modes that do not produce a 404: a stopped mounted container falling through to the domain's container, and any `traefik.` label disabling both variables.

## [2026-08-07]

### Added

- Added upstream-synced `grilling`, `grill-me`, `domain-modeling`, and `grill-with-docs` skills for structured plan interviews and inline domain documentation.

### Changed

- Generalized the `sf-writing-style` skill interaction rules: it is now the explicit baseline for every prose-writing skill (harness or locally installed), with the previously named skills kept as examples.
- Updated upstream skill sync workflows to use `actions/checkout@v7`.

### Fixed

- `glab` skill: require loading before every GitLab command or write, expose attribution, reference, host, and safety policy in the trigger description, and add trigger plus attribution regression evals.

## [2026-08-06]

### Changed

- Expanded the `sf-writing-style` trigger scope to cover tool-mediated human-facing prose, including issue and PR/MR content, comments, reviews, Slack messages, progress updates, release notes, and incident updates.

## [2026-08-05]

### Fixed

- `spark-http-proxy` skill: add the missing catalog description so it shows up in the `sjust sf-agents-status` DESCRIPTION column, and list it among the available system skills.
- Documentation: list `adr-creator`, `adversarial-verify`, and `figma-bridge` among the available system skills.

## [2026-08-04]

### Added

- `sf-container-build` skill: design, modify, review, and debug container images with explicit platform and libc contracts, per-platform runtime tests, trusted artifact and package repository verification, rootless runtime guidance, generated-file ownership checks, and SparkFabrik build conventions.

## [2026-08-03]

### Changed

- Upstream skill sync: refresh `system/playwright-cli` from the declared source repository.

## [2026-07-30]

### Added

- Angular skill category: official `angular-developer` and `angular-new-app` skills synchronized from `angular/skills`, ready for global opt-in through Sparkdock.

### Changed

- Upstream skill sync: support category-specific destinations and use a main-only GitHub environment with a repository-scoped App token to automatically squash-merge validated scheduled sync PRs with dated changelog entries. Manual dispatches remain review-only.

## [2026-07-25]

### Added

- `security-assessment` skill: orchestrate a Vulnerability Assessment track (static code and dependency scanning, Docker scan containers, manual review) and a Penetration Testing track (live recon and exploitation, hardened Nuclei runner, Drupal runbook) into one standalone branded HTML report with per-check pass/fail evidence.

### Removed

- `code-security-audit` skill: replaced by `security-assessment`, which absorbs its scan workflow and stack references.

## [2026-07-23]

### Added

- `sf-writing-style` skill: canonical SparkFabrik writing style for every markdown and prose artifact (READMEs, docs, MR/issue descriptions, comments, changelogs). Aired short paragraphs, bulleted lists with bold lead-ins, a total ban on em and en dashes, an AI-slop blacklist, and bundled before/after rewrite examples.

### Changed

- `gh` and `glab` skills: the inline plain-prose and AI-slop authoring sections are now compact stubs that keep the terse-style override and the dash ban, and point to `sf-writing-style` for the full ruleset.
- `doc-coauthoring` skill: gains a custom section pointing the drafting and quality-check passes to `sf-writing-style`.

## [2026-07-21]

### Added

- `glab` skill: documents creating groups and subgroups (`POST groups` with `parent_id`) and transferring a project to another namespace, including the `transfer_locations` pre-check and the gotcha that current GitLab (18.x) requires `PUT`, not `POST`, on the transfer route.

## [2026-07-14]

### Added

- `postmortem-writing` skill: guided workflow for writing blameless postmortems of software incidents and product failures. Covers summary, quantified impact, UTC timeline, detection, root cause and contributing-factor analysis (Five Whys), resolution, severity classification, and specific owned action items.

## [2026-07-10]

### Changed

- `glab` skill: updating an MR or issue description now requires re-fetching the live description first, because `--description` replaces the entire body and a session-cached copy would erase edits made since creation.

## [2026-07-09]

### Changed

- `gh`, `glab`, and `sf-commit-convention` skills: PR/MR titles follow the Conventional Commits format again (`<type>[(scope)]: <description>`), reverting the human-readable title rule. The commit-subject length and em-dash quality rules stay. Restores the two evals (gh #13, glab #16) that assert conventional PR/MR titles.
- `AGENTS.md`: the changelog policy drops the `[Unreleased]` section. This is a rolling project where every merge to `main` is released, so all entries go straight under a dated section. Existing `[Unreleased]` items were moved to dated sections by their merge date.

## [2026-07-06]

### Added

- `terraform-gcp-dashboards` skill (`skills/terraform/`): create and manage Google Cloud Monitoring dashboards (`google_monitoring_dashboard`) in Terraform without perpetual `dashboard_json` plan drift. Explains the one-directional provider diff suppression and the golden rule (committed JSON must never contain a value the API strips), covers hand-authoring, console export via `gcloud monitoring dashboards describe`, and `terraform import` workflows, and bundles a `normalize_dashboard.py` script (`--write`/`--check`) plus a full `references/normalization-rules.md` inventory of stripped/injected fields, float32 threshold rounding, int64-as-string fields, and enum casing.

## [2026-07-02]

### Changed

- `sf-commit-convention` skill: add two commit-subject quality rules that were previously only in the `gh`/`glab` skills (which govern PR/MR bodies, not commit subjects). Subjects must stay under 72 characters (aim for 50) with detail pushed to the body, and must not use an em dash or en dash as a sentence connector. The skill's own prose was rewritten to obey the new rule, and a fourth eval regresses both checks. Closes the gap that let over-length, em-dash commit subjects ship (for example sparkfabrik/sf-claude-plugins#33)

## [2026-06-20]

### Added

- `spark-http-proxy` skill (`skills/system/`): configure, run, and troubleshoot the [Spark HTTP Proxy](https://github.com/sparkfabrik/http-proxy) local development reverse proxy. Helps agents act directly (edit a project's `compose.yml` to expose a service via `VIRTUAL_HOST`/`VIRTUAL_PORT` or native `traefik.*` labels, generate trusted certificates with `generate-mkcert`, configure `*.loc` DNS) and guide users. Lean `SKILL.md` core plus on-demand `references/` (expose-container, certificates, dns, troubleshooting). Bakes in the SparkFabrik `*.spark.loc` naming convention, including the wildcard-nesting rule (`drupal.client.spark.loc` needs `*.client.spark.loc`), and assumes the CLI is preinstalled on company machines.
- `mermaid-diagrams` skill (`skills/system/`): create clear, well-designed Mermaid diagrams in Markdown documents (READMEs, ADRs, design docs, RFCs). Covers flowcharts, sequence, ER, class, state, and C4/architecture diagrams with eight design principles (deduplicate edges, grouping, color encoding, shapes, edge styles, trimmed labels, direction, legend), per-type reference guides, render-verify guidance, and a worked before/after example.

## [2026-06-19]

### Added

- `glab` skill: document cross-host `glab api` calls -- inside a git repo the remote's host can override `GITLAB_HOST`, so a query to a different host (for example a public `gitlab.com` project from a self-hosted repo) silently returns `404 Project Not Found`; use the `--hostname` flag for `glab api`, which is authoritative, and confirm the host with `glab api --hostname <host> user`

## [2026-06-16]

### Fixed

- `sf-commit-convention` skill: the plain-prose (anti-caveman) guard now explicitly covers MR/PR descriptions, not only titles. This skill loads before every commit and MR/PR title operation, so the guard is complete even when the `glab` or `gh` skill is not active

## [2026-06-10]

### Changed

- `glab` skill: clarify that references autolink only when written bare -- backticked refs render as inline code, and GitHub-style `owner/repo#N` does not autolink on GitLab; reconcile the duplicate "Issue auto-linking" note to point at the canonical rule

## [2026-06-06]

### Changed

- `gh`, `glab`, and `sf-commit-convention` skills: consolidate the "write artifacts in plain prose" guidance into a single section per skill and state explicitly that an active terse output style (e.g. `CAVEMAN MODE ACTIVE`) does not apply to commit messages, MR/PR titles and descriptions, comments, or reviews -- these are always written in full prose

## [2026-05-29]

### Changed

- `sf-commit-convention` skill: split the heavy 240-line SKILL.md into a lean ~120-line core (branch naming, format detection, conventional/legacy formats, issue references, Assisted-by trailer) plus a bundled `reference.md` loaded on demand for worked git examples, GPG signing, non-interactive git, and format-detection edge cases. Cuts the skill's resident context cost (~22% of session usage per `/status`) by roughly half with no loss of guidance

## [2026-05-27]

### Fixed

- `glab` skill: stop generating GitLab issue titles in Conventional Commits format -- add an explicit "Issue title format" subsection requiring human-readable noun phrases (sentence case, under ~60 chars, no `feat:`/`fix:`/`chore:` prefixes, no `Bug:`/`Feature:` pseudo-prefixes), with categorization deferred to labels. Includes bad/good examples table. Four new eval cases (#27-#30) cover bug/feature/chore/docs prompts; eval #1 augmented with title-format assertions. Eval run: 25/25 (100%) on the patched skill vs 19/25 (76%) on the pre-fix snapshot
- `gh` skill: stop generating GitHub issue titles in Conventional Commits format -- mirror the glab fix with an "Issue title format" subsection (human-readable noun phrases, sentence case, under ~60 chars, no `feat:`/`fix:`/`chore:` prefixes, no `Bug:`/`Feature:` pseudo-prefixes; categorization on labels). Includes bad/good examples table. Adds `## Issues` H2 heading that previously was missing. Four new eval cases (#14-#17) cover bug/feature/chore/docs prompts; eval #1 augmented with title-format assertions. Eval run: 25/25 (100%) on the patched skill vs 21/25 (84%) on the pre-fix snapshot

## [2026-05-25]

### Changed

- `sf-create-agentsmd` skill: add Step 4 to manage a `CLAUDE.md` symlink alongside the root `AGENTS.md` -- auto-create relative symlink when `CLAUDE.md` is absent, preserve and warn when an existing regular file or mismatched symlink is found, no-op when already pointing at `AGENTS.md`, and explicit prompt with default No for non-root AGENTS-style files (subproject `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/AGENTS.project.md`). Three new evals cover scaffold, existing-CLAUDE.md, and subdir prompt scenarios. Capability spec at `openspec/specs/agentsmd-claude-symlink/`

## [2026-05-15]

### Changed

- Project renamed from `sf-awesome-copilot` to `sf-agents-harness` -- updated descriptions, references, and GitHub metadata to reflect broader scope beyond any single AI coding tool
- `glab` skill: auto-closing issues on merge via `Closes`/`Fixes` directives in MR descriptions is now optional -- the agent asks the user before including a closing reference, since auto-close is not always desired

## [2026-04-22]

### Added

- `sf-commit-convention` skill (`skills/system/`): enforce SparkFabrik commit message and branch naming conventions -- adaptive format detection from git log history (conventional, legacy, Jira-style, custom) with most-recent-commit-wins for mixed logs and user prompt for unrecognizable histories, commit-msg hook error parsing for automatic format recovery, mandatory issue references in commit footers only (`Refs:`/`Closes:` trailers with fully qualified project path, never bare `#N` or in the subject line), branch naming (`feat/<issue>-<desc>`, `fix/<issue>-<desc>`, etc.), lowercase `Assisted-by` AI trailer on every commit, and non-interactive git operation guidance (avoid `-i`/`--interactive` flags, editors, and TTY-dependent commands)
- `skill-creator` custom section: document `opencode run` as an alternative to `claude -p` for running skill evals, including OpenCode JSON event schema and skill-trigger detection pattern; enforce `github-copilot/gpt-4.1` as default model for evals to avoid premium model costs
- `gh` and `glab` skills: warn about accidental issue auto-linking -- wrap `#N` in backticks when used as examples rather than intentional references

## [2026-04-20]

### Changed

- `glab` skill: require fully-qualified references (`group/project#N`, `group/project!N`) in all written content (descriptions, comments, notes) to prevent broken cross-project links

### Fixed

- `glab` skill: document `-f` vs `-F` flag difference for `glab api` — `-f key=@file` sends the literal string while `-F key=@file` reads the file content; using the wrong flag silently corrupts note/description updates

## [2026-04-15]

### Added

- `drupal-major-upgrade-validation` skill (`skills/drupal/`): validate Drupal major version upgrades (e.g., D10 to D11) by capturing a browser-automation baseline on the stable branch, applying the upgrade, re-running the same tests, and producing a structured comparison report with per-page status, console error diffs, and screenshot references

### Changed

- README: Removed VS Code Insiders requirement for `chat.useAgentSkills` directive -- Agent Skills are now available in the standard VS Code release

## [2026-04-13]

### Added

- `glab` skill: group-level API patterns (list projects in a group, subgroups, descendant projects) in both SKILL.md and `references/api-patterns.md`

### Fixed

- `glab` skill: document `--paginate` concatenation pitfall -- paginated responses produce invalid JSON (`[...][...]`) that breaks `jq`; added `jq -s 'add'` workaround with examples

## [2026-04-11]

### Added

- `config/catalog.json`: machine-readable short descriptions for all system skills and agents, consumed by `sparkdock-agents-status` for a DESCRIPTION column in the terminal table -- includes JSON Schema (`config/catalog.schema.json`) for editor support and validation
- `sf-create-agentsmd` skill: discovery-driven AGENTS.md generator and reviewer for non-pkg projects -- inspects project structure, languages, package managers, task runners, Docker setup, and CI config, then generates or audits an AGENTS.md with supply chain safety (live registry checks, 5-day release quarantine), tiered command safety policy, git workflow conventions, and OpenSpec change management
- `AGENTS.md`: distribution section documenting the sparkdock sync pipeline (`skills/system/` and `agents/system/` to developer workstations via `sjust sf-agents-refresh`)

### Removed

- `create-agentsmd` skill: removed generic upstream skill (from `github/awesome-copilot`) -- superseded by `sf-create-agentsmd` which includes discovery-driven generation, supply chain safety, command safety policy, and monorepo considerations

## [2026-04-09]

### Added

- `auto-format-doc` skill: auto-format files after creating or modifying them using external formatters managed by Just recipes (`sjust` on macOS, `ajust` on Linux) -- supports Markdown via Prettier with try-Just-then-npx fallback chain (`format-md` recipe preferred, `npx prettier@3` when it fails), format-check support, and warn-and-continue error handling
- `auto-format-doc` skill: 6 eval scenarios (create, edit, multi-file, implicit trigger, fallback-on-recipe-failure, check-without-writing)

## [2026-04-08]

### Fixed

- `glab` skill: document correct state filtering for `glab issue list` and `glab mr list` -- `glab` uses `--closed`/`--all` flags, not `--state` (which is a `gh` flag and fails with "Unknown flag")

### Added

- `glab` skill: three new eval cases for issue/MR state filtering (open issues, closed issues, all MRs) testing that agents use `--closed`/`--all` instead of the invalid `--state` flag

## [2026-04-02]

### Added

- `githuman` skill: review AI-generated code before committing via GitHuman Docker instances managed by Just recipes (`sjust` on macOS, `ajust` on Linux). Synced from [mcollina/githuman-skills](https://github.com/mcollina/githuman-skills) with frontmatter description override and custom sections that override upstream `npx githuman` examples with sjust/ajust command mapping, infrastructure conventions, and troubleshooting — upstream rules files are the authoritative reference
- `githuman` skill: 8 eval scenarios (review, list/cleanup, troubleshooting, inline comments, resolve-and-commit, todos, export, selective staging) enforcing Just recipe usage, plus 20 trigger evals for description auto-triggering tests

## [2026-03-31]

### Added

- `agentic-security-audit` skill: structured audit for AI agent configurations, instruction files, and LLM integration code -- two-phase workflow (discovery + LLM-driven review) mapped to the OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications (ASI01-ASI10), with reference files for OWASP agentic patterns and instruction file audit methodology across tools (Copilot, Cursor, OpenCode, Aider, MCP)

### Changed

- `code-security-audit` skill: renamed from `security-audit` to `code-security-audit` to clearly differentiate from `agentic-security-audit` (code security vs AI integration security)
- `code-security-audit` skill: restructured from two-phase to five-phase workflow (Discovery, Generate Containers, Native Scans, Docker Scans, Manual Review) with PHP/Drupal support, per-stack Docker container generation, and an expanded tool matrix spanning multiple container types
- `code-security-audit` skill: pin all 17 scanner versions in Dockerfile templates with SHA-256 checksum verification for binary downloads (trivy, gitleaks, grype, syft, gosec, local-php-security-checker); replace `curl | sh` and `@latest` install patterns with versioned release URLs; add staleness check and version recording to the audit workflow

## [2026-03-29]

### Fixed

- `glab` skill: document that `glab mr close`, `glab issue close`, `glab mr reopen`, and `glab issue reopen` do not accept `--message` -- close/reopen with an explanation requires a separate `note` command first

### Added

- `glab` skill: two new eval cases for close-with-explanation scenarios (MR and issue)
- `playwright-cli` skill: fix npx fallback to use correct package name `@playwright/cli` instead of deprecated `playwright-cli`

## [2026-03-28]

### Fixed

- `glab` skill: warn against `glab ci view` (requires interactive TTY, always fails in agent contexts) and document `glab ci get` as the correct non-interactive alternative for fetching pipeline details
- `glab` skill: fix `glab ci artifact` documentation (wrong syntax and missing deprecation notice)

### Added

- `glab` skill: two new eval cases for pipeline detail retrieval, testing that agents avoid TTY commands and use correct flag syntax

## [2026-03-24]

### Added

- `code-security-audit` skill: two-phase security audit workflow for web applications and APIs -- Phase 1 runs automated open-source scanners (semgrep, trivy, gosec, govulncheck, npm audit, bandit), Phase 2 guides a manual deep review across 10 OWASP-aligned categories with structured findings and a final report template
- `code-security-audit` skill: Go security reference (`references/go-security.md`) covering SQL injection, command injection, path traversal, XSS in templates, cookie security, server hardening, open redirect, HMAC timing attacks, race conditions, and gosec rules
- `code-security-audit` skill: Node.js/frontend security reference (`references/nodejs-security.md`) covering DOM XSS, prototype pollution, SQL/NoSQL injection, path traversal, SSRF, dependency security, Express hardening, CSP, and semgrep rules

## [2026-03-23]

### Added

- `skill-creator` skill: non-Claude agent guidance with bundled script compatibility table and correct terminology mapping for OpenCode/Copilot CLI
- `glab` skill: three new eval cases for squash/merge-behavior flag correctness on MR creation vs merge

### Fixed

- `glab` skill: document `--squash-before-merge` flag for `glab mr create` and warn against using `--squash` (which only works on `glab mr merge`)

## [2026-03-22]

### Added

- `glab` skill: repository files section -- fetch file contents, browse directories, and handle cross-project file access via `glab api` instead of WebFetch/curl
- `glab` skill: three new eval cases for repository file URL scenarios (raw file, blob, tree)
- `gh`, `glab` skills: MR/PR titles must follow the Conventional Commits format (`<type>[(scope)]: <description>`)
- `gh`, `glab` skills: new eval case for Conventional Commits title format in MR/PR creation
- `create-agentsmd` skill: prompt for generating an AGENTS.md file for a repository. Synced from [github/awesome-copilot](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot)
- GitHub Actions workflow to validate the upstream skills manifest and verify synced skills are up to date

### Changed

- `glab` skill: "Before you start" section now explicitly calls out file URLs (`/-/raw/`, `/-/blob/`, `/-/tree/`) as GitLab resources that require `glab api`
- `glab` skill: updated description to mention repository files and file URLs for better auto-triggering

## [2026-03-21]

### Changed

- `playwright-cli` skill: proactively detect whether `playwright-cli` binary is installed and fall back to `npx playwright-cli` when not found

### Fixed

- `gh`, `glab` skills: AI attribution header now uses blockquote format (`) instead of bare text with `---` separator -- fixes double-separator rendering issues and provides consistent visual distinction on both GitHub and GitLab
- `gh`, `glab` skills: added heredoc warning about single-quoted delimiters suppressing variable expansion in attribution header

## [2026-03-20]

### Added

- `skill-creator` skill: create, iterate, and benchmark agent skills with eval-driven workflows. Synced from [anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills)
- `doc-coauthoring` skill: structured workflow for co-authoring documentation, proposals, and technical specs. Synced from [anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills)
- `gh` skill: GitHub CLI skill for issues, pull requests, Actions, releases, search, PR review comment replies, safety protocol, and API patterns reference with 12 eval scenarios
- `README.md`: skills table and `AGENTS.md` rule to keep it updated when adding/removing skills
- `playwright-cli` skill: browser automation skill synced from [microsoft/playwright-cli](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-cli), with custom output file conventions (screenshots, PDFs, videos, traces directed to `.playwright-cli/` instead of project root)
- Generic upstream skill sync: `scripts/sync-skill.sh` replaces per-skill sync scripts; `config/upstream-skills.json` manifest with JSON schema declares all upstream skills; `.github/workflows/sync-skills.yml` runs weekly auto-sync

### Changed

- Moved sync manifest and schema from `scripts/` to `config/`

### Removed

- `scripts/sync-playwright-cli.sh` and `.github/workflows/sync-playwright-cli.yml` replaced by generic sync mechanism

### Fixed

- `glab` skill: AI attribution examples now use explicit two-step username capture pattern instead of hardcoded placeholder

## [2026-03-18]

### Added

- `glab` skill: file upload workflow documentation (curl-based workaround for glab api multipart limitation, OAuth vs PAT auth header guidance)
- `glab` skill: two new eval cases for file upload scenarios (image to MR, PDF to issue)
- `AGENTS.md`: git workflow rules requiring feature branches and pull requests

### Changed

- `glab` skill: clarified `-F key=@file` in api-patterns.md to warn it reads as string, not multipart

## [2026-03-07]

### Added

- `the-architect` agent: conversational AI oracle for discovery, brainstorming, architecture, and general knowledge (Copilot and OpenCode profiles)
- `SYSTEM.md`: catalog of system agents and skills with directory conventions, install paths, and available resources

## [2026-03-06]

### Changed

- `glab` skill: prioritize GitLab URL detection in skill description to ensure automatic triggering when users paste GitLab links

### Added

- `glab` skill: explicit instruction to never use WebFetch/curl on GitLab URLs (added to "Before you start" section)
- `glab` skill: eval for GitLab URL-based MR explanation scenario
- `glab` skill: automatic issue template selection when creating issues (fetches templates from the project and asks the user to choose)
- `glab` skill: eval for issue template selection workflow

## [2026-03-05]

### Added

- `glab` skill: instruct agent to always declare comment/note authorship on behalf of the user

### Fixed

- `glab` skill: document `id` vs `iid` milestone pitfall to prevent 404 API errors

### Changed

- `glab` skill: moved from `skills/gitlab/` to `skills/system/` category
- `glab` skill: streamlined milestone `id`/`iid` section for clarity

## [2026-03-04]

### Added
