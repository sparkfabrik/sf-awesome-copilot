## Tool availability

Before running the first `playwright-cli` command, check whether the binary is available:

```bash
command -v playwright-cli >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "installed" || echo "not installed"
```

- If **installed**, use `playwright-cli` directly for all commands.
- If **not installed**, use `npx -y @playwright/cli` as a drop-in replacement for all commands. The npm package is `@playwright/cli` (not `playwright-cli`, which is a deprecated old package). The `-y` flag skips the install confirmation prompt, which is required for non-interactive use.

All examples in this skill use `playwright-cli` directly. When the binary is not found, prepend `npx -y @playwright/cli` instead of `playwright-cli` in each command. For example:

```bash
# Binary available
playwright-cli open https://example.com

# Binary not available -- use npx with the correct package name
npx -y @playwright/cli open https://example.com
```

## Output file conventions

By default, playwright-cli writes screenshots, PDFs, and other output files to the current working directory, which is usually the project root. This clutters the repo with temporary files that shouldn't be committed.

**Always use `--filename=` with a path under `.playwright-cli/`** to keep output files in a dedicated directory.

### Per-type examples

| Type | Command |
|------|---------|
| Screenshot | `playwright-cli screenshot --filename=.playwright-cli/screenshot-login.png` |
| Element screenshot | `playwright-cli screenshot e5 --filename=.playwright-cli/button-detail.png` |
| PDF | `playwright-cli pdf --filename=.playwright-cli/page.pdf` |
| Video | `playwright-cli video-stop .playwright-cli/session-recording.webm` |
| Snapshot | Already defaults to `.playwright-cli/` -- no change needed |
| Trace | `playwright-cli tracing-stop` writes to `traces/` by default -- keep this default |

### Naming

Use descriptive filenames that reflect what the output captures:

```bash
# GOOD -- clear purpose
playwright-cli screenshot --filename=.playwright-cli/screenshot-after-login.png
playwright-cli screenshot --filename=.playwright-cli/screenshot-error-state.png

# AVOID -- auto-generated timestamps are hard to reference
playwright-cli screenshot
```

### .gitignore

Add these entries to the project's `.gitignore` to prevent output files from being committed:

```
.playwright-cli/
traces/
```

### Cleanup

`playwright-cli close` does not remove output files. When output files are no longer needed, remove them or inform the user where they were saved so they can decide.
