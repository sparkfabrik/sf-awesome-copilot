# glab CLI Skill

Use the `glab` CLI for ALL GitLab-related tasks including working with issues, merge requests, CI/CD pipelines, and releases. If given a GitLab URL, use `glab` to get the information needed.

## Before you start

1. **Detect GitLab URLs**: If the user provided a URL containing "gitlab" in the hostname, this is a GitLab resource. Do NOT use WebFetch, curl, or browser-based tools -- GitLab instances require authentication that only `glab` can provide. Extract the hostname and project path from the URL and proceed with `glab` commands. This applies to **all** GitLab URL types, including file URLs (`/-/raw/`, `/-/blob/`, `/-/tree/`) -- see the "Repository files" section for how to fetch file contents via `glab api`.
2. **Confirm it's a GitLab project**: check `git remote -v` for "gitlab" in the URL. If so, use `glab` (not `gh`).
3. **Verify authentication**: run `glab auth status`. If not authenticated for the relevant hostname, **stop and ask the user** -- do not proceed.

## CLI-first principle

**Always prefer glab subcommands** (`glab issue list`, `glab mr list`, `glab ci status`, etc.) over raw `glab api` calls. The CLI subcommands provide better output formatting, pagination, and are less error-prone. Use `glab api` **only** when no subcommand covers the operation (see the `glab api` section below).

## Targeting a project

Before running any `glab` command, determine the project context:

1. **User provided a GitLab URL** (e.g., `https://gitlab.example.com/team/project/-/issues/42` or `https://gitlab.example.com/team/project/-/boards/1`):
   Extract the **hostname** and **group/project path** from the URL, then use `GITLAB_HOST` + `-R`:

   ```bash
   # URL: https://gitlab.example.com/team/project/-/boards/123
   # Extracted hostname: gitlab.example.com
   # Extracted path: team/project
   GITLAB_HOST=gitlab.example.com glab issue list -R team/project --milestone "Sprint 1" --all
   GITLAB_HOST=gitlab.example.com glab milestone list --project team/project --state active
   ```

2. **Inside a git repo with a GitLab remote**: no `-R` or `GITLAB_HOST` needed, `glab` detects the project and hostname from the remote automatically.

3. **No URL provided and not inside a git repo**: **ask the user** for the full GitLab project URL before proceeding. Do not guess or assume a project.

### Self-hosted instances: always use `GITLAB_HOST`

For **self-hosted GitLab instances** (anything other than `gitlab.com`), always set the `GITLAB_HOST` environment variable. This is the only reliable method that works across **all** subcommands.

**Do NOT** rely on `-R <hostname>/<group>/<project>` alone -- some subcommands (e.g., `glab milestone list`) ignore the hostname in the `-R` flag and default to `gitlab.com`. Using `GITLAB_HOST` avoids this inconsistency.

**Do NOT** use `--hostname` -- it is not a valid flag on most subcommands (it only works on `glab auth` and `glab api`).

```bash
# CORRECT -- works for ALL subcommands on self-hosted instances:
GITLAB_HOST=gitlab.example.com glab issue list -R team/project --all
GITLAB_HOST=gitlab.example.com glab milestone list --project team/project --state active
GITLAB_HOST=gitlab.example.com glab mr list -R team/project

# WRONG -- may silently hit gitlab.com instead of your self-hosted instance:
glab milestone list -R gitlab.example.com/team/project --project team/project
```

### Targeting a host different from the repo's git remote (use `--hostname` for `glab api`)

Inside a git repo, `glab` resolves the host from the repo's git remote, and that resolution can **override `GITLAB_HOST`**. So when you are inside a repo on host A (for example a self-hosted instance) but need to query host B (for example `gitlab.com`), `GITLAB_HOST=B glab api ...` may silently still hit host A and return `404 Project Not Found` for a project that exists on B.

For `glab api`, pass the **`--hostname` flag** instead. It is authoritative: it beats both the repo remote and `GITLAB_HOST`.

```bash
# Inside a self-hosted repo, querying a public gitlab.com project: CORRECT
glab api --hostname gitlab.com "projects/gitlab-org%2Fterraform-provider-gitlab/issues/6841"

# GITLAB_HOST can lose to the repo remote for a cross-host api call: do NOT rely on it
GITLAB_HOST=gitlab.com glab api "projects/gitlab-org%2Fterraform-provider-gitlab/..."   # may 404
```

Telltale sign you hit the wrong host: a `404 Project Not Found` for a project you know exists. It is easy to miss when your username exists on both instances, because `glab api user` then succeeds on either host and masks which one answered. Confirm the host with `glab api --hostname <host> user` (compare the returned user id), not just the username.

## Handling auth errors

If any `glab` command fails with "Unauthenticated", "401", "403", or "connection refused", **stop immediately**. Do NOT work around auth failures with WebFetch, curl, or `gh`. Self-hosted GitLab instances are private -- those fallbacks will also fail.

Present the user with these options:

### Option 1: OAuth login (preferred -- more secure, tokens auto-refresh)

```bash
glab auth login --hostname <hostname> --use-keyring
# Select "Web" → browser opens → authorize → done
```

If OAuth fails (no OAuth app configured on the instance), fall back to a PAT.

### Option 2: Personal Access Token

Check git protocol to recommend minimal scopes:

- **SSH users** (`git@...` remote): `api` scope is sufficient
- **HTTPS users** (`https://...` remote): `api` + `write_repository`

Tell the user to generate a token at: `https://<hostname>/-/user_settings/personal_access_tokens?scopes=api,write_repository` — recommend a short expiry (30-90 days).

```bash
glab auth login --hostname <hostname> --token <token> --use-keyring
```

### Option 3: Skip the operation

**Always use `--use-keyring`** to store credentials in the OS keyring. Never store tokens in plaintext config.

## Core terminology

| GitHub       | GitLab                                                       | CLI            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| Pull Request | **Merge Request**                                            | `glab mr`      |
| Gist         | **Snippet**                                                  | `glab snippet` |
| Actions      | **CI/CD**                                                    | `glab ci`      |
| `OWNER/REPO` | `GROUP/PROJECT` (supports nesting: `GROUP/SUBGROUP/PROJECT`) | --             |
| PR `#15`     | MR `!15`                                                     | --             |

Issues use `#`, merge requests use `!`. When writing content (descriptions, comments, notes), always use fully-qualified references -- see "Fully-qualified references" below.

### Fully-qualified references

When writing any content that will be posted to GitLab -- issue descriptions, MR descriptions, comments, notes -- **always use fully-qualified references** for issues and merge requests. Short references like `#42` or `!15` only resolve within the same project. They break in group-level views, cross-project links, boards, notifications, and any context where the reader is not already inside the originating project.

**Correct (fully-qualified):**

```
Closes team/project#42
See also team/project!15

# Nested subgroups work the same way:
Relates to team/frontend/webapp#8
Superseded by team/backend/api!102
```

**Incorrect (short refs -- fragile):**

```
Closes #42
See also !15
```

**How to get the project path:** resolve it from the API before writing content. Do this every time -- the user may switch projects or reference resources across multiple projects during a session.

```bash
# For the current repo:
glab api projects/:id | jq -r '.path_with_namespace'
# → team/subgroup/project

# For a different project (URL-encode slashes):
GITLAB_HOST=gitlab.example.com glab api \
  "projects/team%2Ffrontend%2Fwebapp" | jq -r '.path_with_namespace'
```

When referencing resources from **multiple projects** in the same description or comment, resolve each project path individually.

This is especially important for **cross-project references**. A bare `#42` or short `project#42` only resolves inside the originating project and will not render as a link elsewhere. When the issue or MR lives in a _different_ project than the one you are writing in, always use the full namespace path, including any subgroups: `group/subgroup/project#123`. For example, to reference the platform-team board from a code repository, write `sparkfabrik-innovation-team/board#4379`, never a bare `board#4379` or `#4379`. Apply this in prose and in footers alike (`Closes:`, `Refs:`).

**Bare, not backticked.** A reference only autolinks when written bare. Wrapping it in backticks renders it as inline code, not a link, so keep file paths, flags, and identifiers in backticks but leave issue and merge request references bare. A GitHub-style reference such as `owner/repo#12` is not a GitLab project path and will not autolink on GitLab at all; use an explicit markdown link to the GitHub URL instead.

This rule applies **only to written content** (descriptions, comments, closing keywords). CLI arguments like `glab issue view 42` target the current project implicitly and do not need qualification.

### Write in plain, professional prose

Issue and MR titles and descriptions, comments and notes, and commit messages are durable, outward-facing artifacts: write them in complete, well-structured English with proper markdown, regardless of any active terse output style. A session-level reminder such as `CAVEMAN MODE ACTIVE` applies to your conversational replies, never to these artifacts; do not toggle the style, write the artifact in full prose and resume the terse style in chat. Never use the em dash (—) or en dash (–); rewrite with a period, comma, colon, or parentheses, and prefer short paragraphs and lists over dense run-ons.

**Load the `sf-writing-style` skill for the full SparkFabrik ruleset** (air, bold lead-in lists, slop blacklist, before/after examples) before composing any of these artifacts.

---

## Writing on behalf of the user

Every piece of content you create on GitLab carries this attribution header, with no exceptions: MR and issue descriptions, comments and notes, and `glab api` body fields.

```
> :robot: _This was written by an AI agent on behalf of @<username> (<agentname>/<full-model-id>)._
```

Fetch the username, never hardcode it. Substitute your own runtime identity for `<agentname>/<full-model-id>`: agent name all lowercase, the model ID exactly as your runtime reports it (including any suffix), never a friendly name. It is the same string the `sf-commit-convention` skill puts in the `Assisted-by` commit trailer, so keep the two identical.

Fetch and post in a **single command**. A separate command runs in its own shell, so the variable is gone by the time you post and expands to nothing, rendering `on behalf of @ (...)` with no username. `glab api` has no `--jq` flag (that is a `gh` feature), so pipe to `jq`.

```bash
GL_USERNAME=$(GITLAB_HOST=gitlab.example.com glab api user | jq -r '.username')
GITLAB_HOST=gitlab.example.com glab issue note 42 -R group/project \
  --message "> :robot: _This was written by an AI agent on behalf of @${GL_USERNAME} (claude-code/claude-opus-5)._

## Triage

Root cause identified: ..."
```

With a heredoc body, never single-quote the delimiter (`<<'EOF'`): a quoted delimiter suppresses expansion and emits the literal `$GL_USERNAME`.

```bash
GL_USERNAME=$(GITLAB_HOST=gitlab.example.com glab api user | jq -r '.username')
GITLAB_HOST=gitlab.example.com glab mr create --title "feat: add dark mode" --description "$(cat <<EOF
> :robot: _This was written by an AI agent on behalf of @${GL_USERNAME} (claude-code/claude-opus-5)._

## Summary

- Adds dark mode toggle to settings page
EOF
)"
```

> **Issue auto-linking:** GitLab renders a bare reference as a clickable link, but a backticked one renders as inline code and does not link. Use backticks when referring to a number as text (examples, tables, logs), and leave it bare when it should link to an actual issue (e.g., `Closes #42`). See "Fully-qualified references" above for the full rule, including cross-project paths and GitHub-style refs.

---

## Issues

### Issue title format

Issue titles must be **human-readable, short, and concise** — a few words that express the goal or scope of the work. Issue titles are NOT commit messages and must NOT use the Conventional Commits format (no `feat:`, `fix(scope):`, `chore:` prefixes, no imperative commit-style phrasing).

The title is read by humans scanning boards, backlogs, and notifications — it should describe **what the issue is about**, not how the eventual fix will be committed. Conventional Commits belongs on MR titles and commit messages, where it drives changelogs and tooling. Issues sit upstream of that, often before the solution is even known, so a commit-shaped title is both premature and harder to scan.

Style guidelines:

- Sentence case, no trailing period.
- Aim for under ~60 characters.
- Prefer noun phrases ("Slow dashboard load on Safari") or short problem statements ("Users locked out after password reset") over imperative verbs.
- Do not prefix with `Bug:`, `Feature:`, `Task:`, etc. — use **labels** (`type::bug`, `type::feature`) for categorization instead.

**Examples:**

| Bad (commit-shaped)                            | Good (human-readable)             |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `feat(auth): add JWT token refresh`            | `JWT token refresh`               |
| `fix: prevent crash on empty password`         | `Login crash with empty password` |
| `docs(api): update rate limiting section`      | `Rate limiting docs out of date`  |
| `refactor(parser): simplify config validation` | `Simplify config parser`          |
| `chore: bump dependencies`                     | `Update dependencies`             |
| `Bug: login broken on Safari`                  | `Login broken on Safari`          |

### Issue commands

```bash
glab issue create --title "Login broken on Safari" --description "..." --label "type::bug,priority::high" --assignee "@me"
glab issue list --assignee=@me                    # list my issues
glab issue list --label="bug" --search="login"    # filter and search
glab issue view 42 --comments                     # view with comments
glab issue note 42 --message "Root cause found."  # add a comment
glab issue update 42 --label "confirmed"          # update metadata
glab issue close 42                               # close (ask confirmation first)
glab issue reopen 42
```

### State filtering (open / closed / all)

`glab` does **not** have a `--state` flag (that's `gh`, not `glab`) — using it fails with "Unknown flag". Use these flags instead:

| What you want       | `glab issue list` | `glab mr list` |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | -------------- |
| Open only (default) | _(no flag)_       | _(no flag)_    |
| Closed only         | `--closed`        | `--closed`     |
| All (open + closed) | `--all`           | `--all`        |
| Merged only         | n/a               | `--merged`     |

> **Closing/reopening with a comment**: `glab issue close` and `glab issue reopen` do not accept `--message`. Add a note first: `glab issue note 42 --message "..."`, then `glab issue close 42`.

### Issue template selection

Many GitLab projects define issue templates (stored in `.gitlab/issue_templates/`) that encode the team's expected structure -- sections to fill, checklists, labels via quick actions. Skipping these creates issues that don't match the project's conventions and forces manual cleanup.

Before creating any issue, check for templates:

1. **List templates**: `glab api projects/:id/templates/issues` -- returns `[{key, name}, ...]`. If empty or 404, the project has none; proceed without a template.
2. **Present choices**: show the available template names and ask the user which one to use.
3. **Fetch the selected template**: `glab api projects/:id/templates/issues/<key>` -- returns `{name, content}` with the full markdown body.
4. **Fill in the template**: use the template content as the issue description. Ask the user for any information the template sections require that they haven't provided yet.

To list just the template names: `glab api projects/:id/templates/issues | jq '.[].name'`.

### Label selection process

If the user specified exact labels, use them. Otherwise:

1. **Discover available labels**: `glab label list` (or `glab api projects/:id/labels` for more detail)
2. **Propose labels that fit** the issue context -- suggest scoped labels (e.g., `priority::high`, `type::bug`) when they exist in the project. Scoped labels use `::` and auto-remove conflicting labels in the same scope.
3. **Ask the user to confirm or adjust** before creating the issue.

Do NOT invent label names. Only propose labels that actually exist in the project.

**Create an MR directly from an issue**: `glab mr for 42` creates a branch and a linked MR. Note that this command automatically adds a closing reference in the MR description, which will close the issue on merge. Ask the user first if this is the desired behaviour.

---

## Merge Requests

### Creating MRs

```bash
glab mr create --title "Fix login crash" --description "Relates to group/project#42" \
  --target-branch develop --reviewer "marco" --assignee "@me"
glab mr create --fill              # title/description from commits
glab mr create --draft --fill      # draft MR
glab mr create --fill --squash-before-merge --remove-source-branch  # with merge behavior flags
```

**Auto-closing issues on merge is optional.** Including `Closes group/project#42` or `Fixes group/project#42` in the MR description will automatically close the linked issue when the MR is merged — but this is not always desirable (e.g., when the issue tracks broader work, or closing it automatically is a project policy violation). **Always ask the user** whether they want the issue to be auto-closed on merge before adding a closing directive. If they confirm, use a fully-qualified reference — never a short form like `Closes #42`.

> **`--squash` vs `--squash-before-merge`**: these are different flags on different commands. `glab mr create` accepts `--squash-before-merge` (configures the MR so commits will be squashed when eventually merged). `glab mr merge` accepts `--squash` (squashes commits at merge time). Using `--squash` with `glab mr create` will fail with "Unknown flag". Same applies to `--remove-source-branch`: both commands support it, but `--when-pipeline-succeeds` is only available on `glab mr merge`.

### MR title format

MR titles must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format:

```
<type>[(optional scope)]: <description>
```

Common types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`.

Use a scope when the change is clearly scoped to a module, component, or area of the codebase. Keep the description lowercase, concise, and in imperative mood.

**Examples:**

```
feat(auth): add JWT token refresh
fix: prevent crash on empty password submission
docs(api): update rate limiting section
refactor(parser): simplify config validation logic
ci: add deploy stage for staging environment
chore: bump dependencies
```

Breaking changes append `!` before the colon: `feat(api)!: change response format for /users endpoint`.

**MR creation checklist** (follow this carefully):

1. **Inspect branch state**: `git status`, `git log <base>...HEAD --oneline`, `git diff <base>...HEAD`
2. **Draft title/description from the actual diff** -- reference specific files, functions, behaviors. Do not just restate the user's request.
3. **Push**: `git push -u origin HEAD` if not yet pushed.
4. **Create**: `glab mr create` with all relevant flags.
5. **Return the MR URL** to the user.

### Reviewing and managing MRs

```bash
glab mr view 15 --comments          # view MR with comments
glab mr diff 15                     # see the diff
glab mr list --reviewer=@me         # MRs needing my review
glab mr checkout 15                 # checkout locally
glab mr note 15 --message "LGTM"   # leave a comment
glab mr approve 15                  # formal approval (separate from notes)
glab mr revoke 15                   # revoke approval
glab mr merge 15 --squash --remove-source-branch --when-pipeline-succeeds
glab mr rebase 15                   # rebase onto target
glab mr update 15 --add-label "reviewed"
glab mr close 15                    # close without merging
```

> **`--description` replaces, never patches.** `glab mr update N --description` (and `glab issue update`, and `glab api -X PUT ... -f description=`) overwrites the entire body. Before any description update, re-fetch the current live content — never reuse a copy cached in the session from creation time, because reviewers, bots, or quick actions may have edited it in between, and your stale copy would silently erase their changes. Fetch the raw markdown (use `glab api`, not `glab mr view`, which formats the output for display), apply your edit to it, then send the merged result:
>
> ```bash
> # 1. Fetch the current raw description
> glab api projects/:id/merge_requests/15 | jq -r '.description' > /tmp/mr-desc.md
> # 2. Edit /tmp/mr-desc.md (append or modify only the section you need)
> # 3. Push the merged result back
> glab mr update 15 --description "$(cat /tmp/mr-desc.md)"
> ```
>
> Preserve any existing AI-attribution header and any content you did not author.

> **`close`/`reopen` do NOT accept `--message`**: unlike `gh pr close --comment`, `glab mr close` and `glab mr reopen` only accept `--repo` -- there is no `--message` or `--comment` flag. The same applies to `glab issue close` and `glab issue reopen`. To close (or reopen) with an explanation, add a note first as a separate command:
>
> ```bash
> # CORRECT -- note first, then close:
> glab mr note 15 --message "Closing: superseded by group/project!20."
> glab mr close 15
>
> # WRONG -- fails with "Unknown flag: --message":
> glab mr close 15 --message "Closing: superseded by group/project!20."
> ```

**Code review workflow**: view MR -> read diff -> check CI (`glab ci status`) -> read comments -> leave feedback -> approve or request changes.

Approval and notes are separate commands -- `glab mr approve` handles GitLab's formal approval system, `glab mr note` posts a comment.

---

## CI/CD

### TTY-only commands -- do NOT use

`glab ci view` is a **full-screen terminal UI** (TUI) that requires an interactive TTY with keyboard input. It will **always fail** in non-interactive contexts (agent bash tools, scripts, piped commands). Never use it.

| Command        | Why it fails             | Use instead                                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `glab ci view` | Requires interactive TTY | `glab ci get` (structured data) or `glab ci status` (text summary) |

### Pipeline commands

```bash
glab ci status                       # pipeline status for current branch
glab ci status --branch main         # pipeline status for a specific branch
glab ci status --branch main --live  # stream status in real-time until pipeline completes
glab ci get                          # pipeline details as JSON (current branch)
glab ci get -b main                  # pipeline details for a specific branch
glab ci get -p <pipeline-id>         # pipeline details for a specific pipeline ID
glab ci get -p <pipeline-id> -d      # include extended job details
glab ci get -p <pipeline-id> -F json # explicit JSON output format
glab ci list                         # recent pipelines for current branch/project
glab ci list --per-page 10           # show more pipelines
glab ci trace                        # stream logs of the active job on current branch
glab ci trace --branch main          # stream logs for a specific branch
glab ci trace --branch main -p <id>  # stream logs for a specific pipeline ID
glab ci trace <job-name>             # stream logs for a specific job by name
glab ci run                          # trigger new pipeline
glab ci retry <pipeline-id>          # retry failed pipeline
glab ci cancel <pipeline-id>         # cancel running pipeline
glab ci artifact <refName> <jobName> # download artifacts (deprecated: use `glab job artifact`)
glab ci lint                         # validate .gitlab-ci.yml syntax
```

**Important:** `glab ci get` accepts **zero positional arguments**. The pipeline ID must be passed via the `-p` / `--pipeline-id` flag, not as a positional argument. Passing it as `glab ci get <id>` will fail with "Accepts 0 arg(s)".

Run `glab ci lint` before committing CI config changes to catch syntax errors early.

### Branch targeting

`glab ci status` and `glab ci trace` default to the **current git branch**. When monitoring pipelines on other branches (e.g., `main` after a push), use `--branch`:

```bash
glab ci status --branch main              # one-shot status check
glab ci status --branch main --live       # stream until pipeline finishes
glab ci trace --branch main               # stream active job logs on main
```

Without `--branch`, these commands look for a pipeline on the current branch, and may fail if none exists.

### Monitoring a specific pipeline

**Preferred: `--live` flag** — streams pipeline status in real-time until the pipeline completes (success, failed, or canceled). No polling loop needed:

```bash
glab ci status --branch main --live
```

**For pipeline details** (non-interactive, structured data):

```bash
# Get pipeline details by ID (JSON output)
glab ci get -p <pipeline-id>

# With extended job details
glab ci get -p <pipeline-id> -d
```

**For job-level detail** within a specific pipeline:

```bash
# 1. Find the pipeline ID

## Repository files

There is no `glab` subcommand for fetching file contents from a repository. Use `glab api` with the GitLab Repository Files API. This is the correct approach whenever a user shares a GitLab file URL or asks to read a file from a GitLab project -- **never** use WebFetch or curl, because GitLab instances (especially self-hosted ones) require authentication.

### Recognizing file URLs

GitLab file URLs follow these patterns:

| URL pattern                            | Meaning                               |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `.../<project>/-/raw/<branch>/<path>`  | Raw file content                      |
| `.../<project>/-/blob/<branch>/<path>` | File viewer (same file, different UI) |
| `.../<project>/-/tree/<branch>/<path>` | Directory listing                     |

When you see any of these, extract the **hostname**, **project path**, **branch**, and **file path**, then use `glab api`.

**Example** -- parsing a real URL:

```
URL: https://gitlab.example.com/team/infra/platform/-/raw/main/deploy/docker-compose.yml?ref_type=heads

  hostname: gitlab.example.com
  project:  team/infra/platform
  branch:   main
  file:     deploy/docker-compose.yml
```

Ignore query parameters like `?ref_type=heads` -- they are UI artifacts, not needed for the API.

### Fetching a file

File paths in the API endpoint must be **URL-encoded** (slashes become `%2F`):

```bash
# File at root (no slashes in path -- no encoding needed):
GITLAB_HOST=gitlab.example.com glab api \
  "projects/team%2Finfra%2Fplatform/repository/files/.gitlab-ci.yml/raw?ref=main"

# File in a subdirectory (slashes must be encoded):
# deploy/docker-compose.yml → deploy%2Fdocker-compose.yml
GITLAB_HOST=gitlab.example.com glab api \
  "projects/team%2Finfra%2Fplatform/repository/files/deploy%2Fdocker-compose.yml/raw?ref=main"
```

The `/raw` suffix returns the file content directly as plain text. Without `/raw`, the API returns JSON with base64-encoded content -- use `/raw` unless you need the metadata.

When you're **inside the target repo's git clone**, the `:id` placeholder is resolved automatically:

```bash
glab api "projects/:id/repository/files/.gitlab-ci.yml/raw?ref=main"
```

### Browsing a directory

```bash
# List files in a directory
GITLAB_HOST=gitlab.example.com glab api \
  "projects/team%2Finfra%2Fplatform/repository/tree?ref=main&path=deploy" \
  | jq '.[].name'

# Recursive listing (use recursive=true)
glab api "projects/:id/repository/tree?ref=main&recursive=true" | jq '.[].path'
```

### Cross-project file access

When the user references a file from a **different project** than the one you're currently in, you must URL-encode the full project path (slashes as `%2F`) and set `GITLAB_HOST`:

```bash
# Reading a file from another project on the same instance:
GITLAB_HOST=gitlab.example.com glab api \
  "projects/other-team%2Fshared-configs/repository/files/templates%2F.gitlab-ci.yml/raw?ref=main"
```

## Safety Protocol

**Your default role is read-only.** Do NOT proactively suggest, offer, or execute state-changing operations. Only perform write or mutating operations when the user explicitly asks for them.

### Tier 1 -- FORBIDDEN (never execute these)

These commands are **never** executed, regardless of what the user asks. If the user needs one of these, explain the consequences and tell them how to run it manually.

| Action                       | Command                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Delete repo                  | `glab repo delete`                             |
| Delete release               | `glab release delete`                          |
| Destructive API calls        | `glab api -X DELETE ...` on critical resources |
| Force push to default branch | `git push --force` to `main`/`master`/default  |
| Hard reset                   | `git reset --hard`                             |

### Tier 2 -- EXPLICIT REQUEST ONLY (never suggest, never offer)

These commands are executed **only** when the user explicitly requests them with clear intent (e.g., "merge the MR", "close issue #42"). Never propose them, never include them in automated workflows, never ask "should I merge/close this?".

Before executing, **always** explain what will happen and ask for confirmation.

| Action                          | Command                               |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Merge MR                        | `glab mr merge`                       |
| Close issue or MR               | `glab issue close`, `glab mr close`   |
| Delete issue or MR              | `glab issue delete`, `glab mr delete` |
| Cancel pipeline                 | `glab ci cancel`                      |
| Force push (non-default branch) | `git push --force`                    |
| Skip hooks                      | `--no-verify`                         |

### Tier 3 -- SAFE WITH CONFIRMATION

These operations can be proposed when relevant, but require a brief confirmation before execution.

| Action                                    | Command                               |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Rebase MR                                 | `glab mr rebase`                      |
| Update metadata (labels, assignees, etc.) | `glab mr update`, `glab issue update` |

### Git safety

- **Prefer `glab mr rebase`** over manual rebase + force push
- When in doubt about target branch, check the project default rather than assuming `main`

---

## Milestones -- `id` vs `iid`

Always look up milestones **by title**, not by numeric ID — this avoids the `id`/`iid` confusion entirely:

```bash
# CORRECT -- lookup by title:
GITLAB_HOST=gitlab.example.com glab api "projects/group%2Frepo/milestones?title=Sprint+49"

# WRONG -- iid (project-scoped) used as path param → 404:
GITLAB_HOST=gitlab.example.com glab api "projects/group%2Frepo/milestones/58"
```

If you must use a numeric ID, use the global `id` field (not `iid`) from the API response:
`{ "id": 551, "iid": 58 }` → use `551` in the path, never `58`.

---

## File uploads (images, attachments)

`glab api` **cannot** do multipart file uploads. It only sends JSON request bodies -- the `-F file=@path` flag reads the file as a string value into a JSON field, not as `multipart/form-data`. For binary files (images, PDFs, etc.) this produces a 400 Bad Request.

There is no `glab upload` subcommand for project uploads either (`glab release upload` only handles release assets).

**Use `curl` with the GitLab project uploads API instead.** Extract the auth token from `glab` for the `curl` request:

### Step 1: Get the token and project ID

```bash
# Get the token (look for the "Token found:" line)
GITLAB_HOST=<hostname> glab auth status -t

# Get the numeric project ID (inside a git repo)
GITLAB_HOST=<hostname> glab api projects/:id | jq '.id'
```

### Step 2: Upload the file

**Detecting token type:** if `glab auth status` shows `Logged in ... (keyring)` without mentioning a PAT (browser login), it's an OAuth token -- use `Authorization: Bearer`. If you provided a PAT directly, use `PRIVATE-TOKEN`. When in doubt, try Bearer first -- if you get a 401, retry with `PRIVATE-TOKEN`.

```bash
curl --silent --show-error --request POST \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  --form "file=@path/to/image.png" \
  "https://<hostname>/api/v4/projects/<project-id>/uploads"
```

### Step 3: Use the returned markdown URL

The upload returns JSON with a `markdown` field ready to paste into descriptions:

```json
{
  "id": 12345,
  "alt": "image",
  "url": "/uploads/<hash>/image.png",
  "markdown": "![image](/uploads/<hash>/image.png)"
}
```

Use this in MR/issue descriptions or comments:

```bash
GITLAB_HOST=<hostname> glab mr update 4 --description "## Screenshot

![image](/uploads/<hash>/image.png)"
```

When adding the screenshot to an existing description, follow the re-fetch rule from "Reviewing and managing MRs": fetch the current raw description first and append to it — `--description` replaces the whole body.

---

## `glab api` -- last resort for advanced operations

> **Do NOT use `glab api` when a CLI subcommand can do the job.** For issues, MRs, CI, labels -- always use the dedicated subcommands first. Use `glab api` only for operations not covered by any subcommand (e.g., group projects, project members, GraphQL queries, custom endpoints).

```bash
glab api projects/:id/members                                        # GET
glab api -X POST projects/:id/issues -f title="New" -f description="..." # POST
glab api -X PUT projects/:id/merge_requests/15 -f title="Updated"   # PUT
glab api projects/:id/issues --paginate                              # paginate
```

### `-f` vs `-F` -- file reading with `@`

`-f key=@file` sends the **literal string** `@file` as the value. `-F key=@file` **reads the file** and sends its content. Using `-f` with `@` silently corrupts the data -- no error, just the wrong value.

```bash
# WRONG -- sends literal "@/tmp/body.txt":
glab api -X PUT projects/:id/issues/42/notes/99999 -f body=@/tmp/body.txt

# CORRECT -- sends file content:
glab api -X PUT projects/:id/issues/42/notes/99999 -F body=@/tmp/body.txt
```

Use `-f` for short inline values (`-f title="Bug fix"`), `-F` for file-backed content (`-F body=@/tmp/note.txt`).

> **`--paginate` concatenation:** `--paginate` outputs each page's JSON array back-to-back (`[...][...]`), which is not valid JSON. Always merge with `jq -s 'add'`:
>
> ```bash
> # WRONG -- breaks on multi-page results:
> glab api projects/:id/issues --paginate | jq '.[].title'
>
> # CORRECT:
> glab api projects/:id/issues --paginate | jq -s 'add | .[].title'
> ```

### Group-level operations

There is no `glab` subcommand for group operations -- use `glab api` with URL-encoded group paths (slashes as `%2F`):

```bash
# List projects in a group
GITLAB_HOST=gitlab.example.com glab api \
  "groups/team%2Fsubgroup/projects" --paginate | jq -s 'add | .[].name' -r | sort

# Include descendant subgroups
GITLAB_HOST=gitlab.example.com glab api \
  "groups/team%2Fsubgroup/projects?include_subgroups=true" --paginate \
  | jq -s 'add | .[].path_with_namespace' -r
```

Placeholder variables (auto-resolved inside a git repo): `:id`, `:fullpath`, `:repo`.

### Creating groups and subgroups

There is no `glab` subcommand for group creation -- use `glab api` with `POST groups`. To create a **subgroup**, pass the parent group's numeric id via `parent_id`:

```bash
# Resolve the parent group id first (URL-encode the path, slashes as %2F):
GITLAB_HOST=gitlab.example.com glab api "groups/team%2Fresearch" | jq '.id'

# Create the subgroup under that parent:
GITLAB_HOST=gitlab.example.com glab api -X POST groups \
  -f name="AI Research" \
  -f path="ai-research" \
  -f parent_id=196 \
  -f description="Research group for PoCs." \
  -f visibility="private"
```

`name` is the human-readable display name; `path` is the URL slug (lowercase, hyphens). A subgroup's `visibility` cannot be more open than its parent (a `private` parent cannot contain a `public` subgroup). Omit `parent_id` to create a top-level group.

### Transferring a project to another namespace

Validate the target first, then transfer. `transfer_locations` returns every namespace the current user is allowed to move the project into, with both `id` and `full_path`:

```bash
# 1. List valid target namespaces:
glab api "projects/:id/transfer_locations" \
  | jq '.[] | {id, full_path}'

# 2. Transfer to the target namespace (numeric group id):
glab api -X PUT "projects/<project-id>/transfer" -f namespace=<group-id>
```

> **Method gotcha (PUT, not POST):** the historical GitLab API docs describe this endpoint as `POST /projects/:id/transfer`, but current GitLab (verified on 18.11 with glab 1.106) does not register the route for `POST` -- a `POST` returns a bare `{"error":"404 Not Found"}` while `PUT` reaches the handler. Use `PUT`. If a `PUT` unexpectedly 404s on an older instance, fall back to `POST`.

The transfer preserves the project's numeric id, history, issues, and MRs, and GitLab leaves a redirect from the old path. Two follow-ups are still required:

- **Update local git remotes** to the new `path_with_namespace` (returned in the transfer response). The old SSH/HTTPS URL keeps working via the redirect, but the canonical path has changed.
- You need **Owner** (or Maintainer, depending on instance settings) on both the project and the target namespace. If `transfer_locations` does not list your intended target, you lack the rights or the target violates a constraint (for example a visibility mismatch), and the transfer will fail.

For comprehensive API patterns (GraphQL, pagination, groups, advanced queries), read `references/api-patterns.md`.
