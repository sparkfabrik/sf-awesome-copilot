description: 'Enforce SparkFabrik commit message and branch naming conventions including conventional commits, legacy format detection, issue references, branch prefixes, and the mandatory Assisted-by trailer. MUST be loaded before EVERY git commit, commit message preparation, MR/PR title creation, branch creation, or any commit-related operation. Use whenever the agent is about to run git commit, git checkout -b, git branch, write a commit message, create a branch, or prepare a merge request or pull request title. Also use when the user mentions "commit", "git commit", "conventional commit", "commit message", "refs #", "assisted-by", "commit convention", "branch name", "new branch", or "feature branch". Never create a commit or branch without consulting this skill first.'

# SparkFabrik Commit Convention

Core rules for every commit and branch. For worked git examples, format-detection
edge cases, non-interactive git, and GPG signing, see [reference.md](reference.md).

## Branch Naming

Pattern: `<prefix>/<issue-number>-<description>`

- All lowercase, hyphens as separators
- Issue number required (except `release/`)
- Description: 2-4 words

| Prefix      | When to use                            |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `feat/`     | New features                           |
| `fix/`      | Bug fixes                              |
| `docs/`     | Documentation only                     |
| `chore/`    | Maintenance, dependencies, config      |
| `refactor/` | Code restructuring, no behavior change |
| `ci/`       | CI/CD pipeline changes                 |
| `test/`     | Test additions or fixes                |
| `release/`  | `release/vX.Y.Z` (no issue number)     |

Examples: `feat/42-add-pdf-ingestion`, `fix/18-oauth-token-refresh`, `release/v1.2.0`

When work belongs on a separate branch (new feature, bug fix, issue-tracked work),
create the branch before committing. If no branch exists, propose a name and confirm
with the user before creating it.

## Format Detection

Before the first commit in a session, detect the project's convention by running
`git log --oneline -5` and matching the dominant pattern:

| Pattern                     | Format               | Example                         |
| --------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `type(scope): description`  | Conventional commits | `feat(auth): add JWT refresh`   |
| `refs #N: description`      | SparkFabrik legacy   | `refs #42: fix token expiry`    |
| `[PROJECT-123] description` | Jira-style           | `[ACME-456] fix login redirect` |
| `PROJECT-123: description`  | Jira-style           | `ACME-456: fix login redirect`  |

Use the dominant format; if mixed, use the most recent commit's format. If there is no
recognizable pattern, ask the user. Cache the detected format for the rest of the
session. A `commit-msg` hook (`.git/hooks/commit-msg`, husky, lefthook) means the format
is enforced, so match it. For hook rejection, custom formats, and caching details, see
[reference.md](reference.md).

## Conventional Commits (preferred)

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `test`, `docs`, `refactor`, `style`, `perf`, `ci`, `build`, `revert`
- Scope: optional but recommended; the component or area changed
- Description: lowercase, imperative mood, no trailing period
- Subject length: keep the whole subject line under 72 characters, and aim for 50. Longer subjects are truncated with `…` in GitHub and GitLab commit lists. Move detail into the commit body, never the subject.
- No AI-slop writing tells: in the subject or body, do not use the em dash (—) or en dash (–) as a sentence connector; rewrite with a period, comma, colon, or parentheses. Write like a human engineer, not a generated summary.

## Legacy Format (transitional)

```
refs #<issue-number>: <description>
```

- Strictly lowercase `refs`, always `#` before the number, colon + space before the description
- Lowercase description, imperative mood
- Validated by git hooks in projects still using it; cross-project references not supported
- The issue reference is part of the subject; no separate footer needed

## Issue References

**Always reference an issue.** If none is apparent from context (branch name,
conversation, MR/PR description), ask the user:

> "Is there a related issue to reference? Provide the number (e.g. `#35`) or the full
> cross-project path (e.g. `owner/project#35`). Type 'none' if there is no related issue."

Skipping the reference is the exception, not the norm. Never silently omit it.

**Always use the fully qualified project path in footers, never a bare `#N`.** A bare
`#N` is ambiguous and breaks when commits are cherry-picked, mirrored, or viewed outside
the original project. Run `git remote get-url origin`, parse the `owner/repo` path, and
resolve a bare `#35` to `<project-path>#35`:

- **Wrong:** `Refs: #35`, `Closes: #42`
- **Correct:** `Refs: sparkfabrik/sf-awesome-copilot#35`, `Closes: sparkfabrik/sf-awesome-copilot#42`

Use `Closes:` when the commit fully resolves the issue, `Refs:` otherwise. (Legacy format
keeps the reference in the subject line instead.)

## Assisted-by Trailer

**Mandatory on every commit**, regardless of format.

- Format: `Assisted-by: <agentname>/<full-model-id>` (agent name MUST be all lowercase)
- Applied via the `--trailer` flag on `git commit`
- Substitute your own runtime identity (agent name and model ID)

Example: `Assisted-by: opencode/github-copilot/claude-opus-4.6`

The same `<agentname>/<full-model-id>` string goes in the AI attribution header that
the `glab` and `gh` skills require on issues, MRs, PRs and comments, so a reader sees
the same agent identity on the commit and on the surrounding discussion.

## MR/PR Titles

Same conventional commit format as the subject line. The issue reference goes in the
MR/PR description body, never in the title.

## Write in plain prose, not caveman

Commit messages (subject and body), MR/PR titles, and MR/PR descriptions are
durable, outward-facing artifacts: write them in normal, complete English. An
active terse output style overrides nothing here. A session-level reminder such
as `CAVEMAN MODE ACTIVE` (drop articles, fragments OK, short synonyms) applies to
your conversational replies, not to these artifacts. Write the commit, title, and
description in full prose regardless of the active style; do not run any command
to toggle the style off.

Avoid AI-slop writing tells in these artifacts too: do not use the em dash (—) or
en dash (–) as a sentence connector; rewrite with a period, comma, colon, or
parentheses. This matches the same rule in the `gh` and `glab` skills for PR/MR
bodies, so subjects, titles, and descriptions all read the same way.

## Quick Example

```bash
git commit -m "feat(rag): add document ingestion pipeline" \
  --trailer "Refs: owner/repo#35" \
  --trailer "Assisted-by: opencode/github-copilot/claude-opus-4.6"
```
