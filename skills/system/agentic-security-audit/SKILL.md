# Agentic Security Audit Skill

Structured audit for AI agent configurations and LLM integration code. The skill
discovers AI-related files and dependencies, reviews them against the OWASP Top
10 for Agentic Applications (ASI01-ASI10), and produces a markdown report.

This skill is **complementary** to the `code-security-audit` skill. That skill audits
application code (SQL injection, XSS, dependency CVEs). This skill audits the AI
integration layer: instruction files, tool configurations, prompt construction,
and trust boundaries.

**Primarily LLM-driven** -- automated tooling for agentic security is still
nascent. The audit relies on structured manual review guided by reference files.

## Before you start

1. Ask the user whether they want a **full audit** (all phases) or a
   **discovery-only** run (Phase 1 only, to understand the AI footprint).
2. Agree on **scope boundaries** upfront: instruction files only, tool configs,
   LLM integration code, or all.

## Phase 1 -- Discovery

Scan the project to identify AI/agentic integration points. Read files directly
-- no tools to invoke in this phase.

### AI instruction file detection

Scan the project for known AI instruction file patterns:

| Pattern | Tool / Purpose |
|---------|---------------|
| `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | GitHub Copilot instructions |
| `AGENTS.md` | Multi-tool agent instructions |
| `.cursorrules` | Cursor AI rules |
| `.cursorignore` | Cursor AI ignore patterns |
| `.opencode/` directory | OpenCode config and skills |
| `.aider.conf.yml` | Aider configuration |
| `.mcp.json`, `mcp.config.*` | MCP server configurations |
| `**/SKILL.md` | Custom agent skills |
| `**/prompts/**`, `**/*.prompt`, `**/*.prompt.md` | Prompt templates |

### LLM SDK dependency detection

Check package manager files for LLM-related dependencies:

| Dependency | Language | Indicates |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| `openai` | Python / Node.js | OpenAI API integration |
| `anthropic` | Python / Node.js | Anthropic API integration |
| `langchain`, `langchain-*` | Python / Node.js | LangChain agent framework |
| `llamaindex`, `llama-index` | Python | LlamaIndex RAG framework |
| `crewai` | Python | CrewAI multi-agent framework |
| `autogen`, `pyautogen` | Python | AutoGen multi-agent framework |
| `drupal/ai`, `drupal/openai` | PHP (Composer) | Drupal AI modules |
| `@modelcontextprotocol/*` | Node.js | MCP SDK |

### Vector DB and RAG detection

Check for vector database or retrieval-augmented generation dependencies:

`chromadb`, `pinecone-client`, `weaviate-client`, `pgvector`, `qdrant-client`,
`milvus`, `faiss-cpu`, `faiss-gpu`.

When found, flag ASI06 (Memory Poisoning) as applicable.

### LLM credential detection

Check `.env`, `.env.example`, `.env.local` and similar files for LLM API
credential patterns: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
`GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY`, `AZURE_OPENAI_*`, `HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN`.

- **Critical finding**: actual credential values committed to version control.
- **Informational**: `.env.example` with placeholder values (indicates LLM usage,
  not a credential leak).

### Applicability mapping

Based on discovery results, determine which OWASP Agentic Top 10 categories
apply:

| Category | Applies when |
|----------|-------------|
| ASI01 Behaviour Hijack | LLM integration code found (prompt construction) |
| ASI02 Tool Misuse | MCP configs or tool definitions found |
| ASI03 Identity & Privilege | LLM integration with auth/session context |
| ASI04 Supply Chain | Instruction files, MCP configs, prompt templates |
| ASI05 Code Execution | Agent with code generation/execution capability |
| ASI06 Memory Poisoning | Vector DB dependencies or RAG pipelines |
| ASI07 Inter-Agent Comms | Multi-agent framework dependencies (crewai, autogen) |
| ASI08 Cascading Failures | LLM output used as input to another LLM/tool |
| ASI09 Human-Agent Trust | HITL patterns in code (approval gates, confirmations) |
| ASI10 Rogue Agents | Multi-agent framework or dynamic agent instantiation |

### Discovery report

Present a structured summary of all findings:

1. AI instruction files found (with file paths)
2. LLM SDK dependencies detected
3. Vector DB / RAG dependencies detected
4. LLM credential indicators found
5. Applicable OWASP Agentic Top 10 categories

Ask the user to confirm before proceeding to Phase 2.

## Phase 2 -- Review

Work through each applicable OWASP Agentic Top 10 category. For each category,
read the relevant files identified in discovery and check against the patterns
in the reference file `references/owasp-agentic-top10.md`.

### Instruction file audit (dedicated sub-section)

Before working through the ASI checklist, audit each instruction file found in
discovery using the patterns in `references/instruction-file-audit.md`. Check
each file for:

- **Overly permissive scope** -- unrestricted file/command access without
  boundaries
- **Credential exposure** -- API keys, tokens, passwords in instruction content
- **Conflicting instructions** -- contradictions between instruction files
- **Injection amplification** -- instructions to follow embedded commands from
  untrusted sources
- **Missing restrictions** -- defines what agent CAN do but omits what it
  should NOT do
- **Stale configurations** -- references deprecated tools, APIs, or patterns
- **Implicit trust** -- no validation guidance for LLM outputs, auto-commit
  without review

### ASI01 -- Agent Behaviour Hijack

Check how user input flows into LLM prompts:

- User input concatenated directly into prompt strings without sanitization
- System prompts that can be overridden by user messages
- No instruction hierarchy enforcement (system vs user vs assistant)
- Missing input validation before prompt construction
- Dynamic goal/instruction modification based on untrusted input

### ASI02 -- Tool Misuse

Check tool definitions and MCP configurations:

- MCP tool definitions with unrestricted file system or network access
- Tool definitions without input validation or schema constraints
- Agents with write access to databases or file systems without approval gates
- Tool chaining that could allow privilege escalation
- Missing rate limiting on tool invocations

### ASI03 -- Identity and Privilege Abuse

Check agent identity and privilege boundaries:

- Agent running with service account or admin credentials
- No per-user scoping of agent actions
- Cached permissions reused across sessions
- Delegation without scope reduction
- Agent actions not attributed to the requesting user in audit logs

### ASI04 -- Supply Chain Vulnerabilities

Check supply chain risks in AI configurations:

- Instruction files not covered by code review process
- Prompt templates loaded from external URLs at runtime
- MCP tools from untrusted or unverified sources
- No integrity checks on agent configurations
- Dynamic plugin or skill loading from unvetted repositories

### ASI05 -- Unexpected Code Execution

Check code execution risks in agent configurations:

- Agent configured with ability to run `eval()`, `exec()`, or shell commands
- Generated code executed without sandboxing or review
- No static analysis applied to AI-generated code before execution
- Unsafe deserialization of agent-produced data
- Dynamic import or require statements influenced by LLM output

### ASI06 -- Memory and Context Poisoning

Check when vector DB or memory systems are detected:

- User input stored in vector DB without validation or sanitization
- RAG retrieval results treated as authoritative without source attribution
- No access control on memory read/write operations
- Cross-user memory contamination (shared memory without session isolation)
- No anomaly detection on memory insertions

### ASI07 -- Insecure Inter-Agent Communication

Check when multi-agent frameworks are detected:

- Unsigned or unvalidated messages between agents
- No schema enforcement on delegation payloads
- Shared memory or context without access control between agents
- Agent-to-agent trust assumed without verification

### ASI08 -- Cascading Hallucination Failures

Check for hallucination propagation risks:

- LLM output used as input to another LLM without validation
- No grounding or fact-checking layer between LLM calls
- Hallucinated output persisted to database or memory
- Self-referencing loops where agent output feeds back into its own context
- No confidence scoring or uncertainty indicators on LLM outputs

### ASI09 -- Human-Agent Trust Exploitation

Check human oversight mechanisms:

- No approval gate on high-impact agent actions (deletes, sends, purchases)
- Bulk approval interfaces that obscure individual action risk
- Agent can bypass human-in-the-loop via delegation or fallback paths
- Missing audit trail for agent actions approved by humans
- Confidence inflation in agent summaries presented to reviewers

### ASI10 -- Rogue Agents

Check when dynamic agent instantiation or multi-agent systems are detected:

- No agent attestation or allowlisting mechanism
- Dynamic agent instantiation from untrusted sources
- No monitoring or logging of agent behavior
- Missing identity verification for agents joining workflows
- No anomaly detection on agent actions

### Non-applicable categories

For categories that don't apply based on discovery results, mark them as
"Not applicable" in the report with a brief explanation (e.g., "Not applicable
-- no vector DB or RAG integration detected"). Do not silently skip them.
