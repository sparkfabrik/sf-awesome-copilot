"""Scan a git change for internal information that should not leave the company.

Reads added lines only (a diff's `+` side), because the question is what this change
*introduces*, not what a repository already contains.

Exit codes:
  0  nothing found
  1  findings at or above the failure threshold
  2  usage or environment error

Severity depends on where the code is going. A container registry path is routine in
a private repository and a disclosure in a public one, so visibility is resolved
first and drives the threshold rather than the patterns.
